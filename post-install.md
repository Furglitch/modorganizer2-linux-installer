# Post install instructions

This document provides information on additional steps you may want to take after installing Mod Organizer 2.

## Running the original game launcher

1. Open Mod Organizer 2;
2. Click on the cogwheel in the top bar to configure executables:

![topbar executables config](screenshots/topbar_executables_config.png?raw=true "Executables Configuration")

3. Click on the launcher in the list to the left;
4. In the "Binary" text box, add an underscore before the name of the .exe file:

![executables list](screenshots/executables_config_leftside_list.png?raw=true "Executables List")

5. Now you should be able to run the launcher by selecting it in the executables dropdown:

![executables dropdown](screenshots/executables_dropdown.png?raw=true "Executables Dropdown")

## Using alternative proton versions

**IMPORTANT:** Proton 6.3 is the most extensively tested version. The author of this document provides no guarantees that alternative versions will work well.

1. Close the game and Mod Organizer 2 if you have them open;
2. Select the Proton version you'd like to use on Steam and wait for it to execute any validations and updates;
3. Purge your existing game prefix to ensure a clean version transition:
	1. Open a file explorer or terminal of your choice;
	2. Navigate to "\<your steam library\>/steamapps/compatdata";
	3. Delete the folder named after the appid of the game - you can find all appids [here](gamesinfo);
4. Launch the game on Steam and let it run the first time setup;
5. (Optional\*) Run the installer again, select no when asked to update Mod Organizer 2;

\*Step 5 is for re-applying protontricks on the newly created prefix. Whether or not that is helpful depends on how well the Proton version you selected works out-of-the-box.

## Launching Mod Organizer 2 outside of Steam

**IMPORTANT:** the author of this document highly advises against this. Steam runs Proton within its own special environment and Mod Organizer 2 may not properly utilize this environment when executed from outside of Steam. You can read [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/k2kyjt/is_it_a_good_idea_to_use_proton_for_non_steam/gdxz70m/) where GloriousEggroll talks about this in more detail.

You can launch non-Steam applications with Proton using `protontricks-launch`.

An example of a shell command for running a Skyrim SE instance would be:

```bash
WINEESYNC=1 WINEFSYNC=1 protontricks-launch --appid 489830 "$HOME/.config/modorganizer2/instances/skyrimspecialedition/modorganizer2/ModOrganizer.exe"
```

You can find the proper appid for the game you want [here](gamesinfo).

## Pass argument to Mod Organizer 2

The first launch option in game properties in Steam is passed as an argument to Mod Organizer 2. This allows to e.g. tell MO2 to launch an executable without having to open its UI and click the run button, like the shortcuts created by MO2 do on Windows.

For example if you want MO2 to run an executable called `exe` directly, add the `moshortcut://exe` launch option in the Steam's game properties.

Then MO2 will skip opening its UI and directly run `exe` when Steam launches the game.
